/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Order` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Order` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `OrderItem` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `OrderItem` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Product` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Product` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Added the required column `clientAddress` to the `Order` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `clientCity` to the `Order` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `clientPhone` to the `Order` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `clientPostalCode` to the `Order` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `productId` on the `OrderItem` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `orderId` on the `OrderItem` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
